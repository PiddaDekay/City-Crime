# City-Crime
Imagine you were the founder and CEO of a new startup dedicated to police enforcement optimization. Pick the name of your startup. As part of your customer acquisition efforts, you schedule multiple appointments with executive officers across the nation to showcase your report depicting the most interesting facts about their city. Your report could incorporate information about a specific geography or aggregated nation-wise. For example, you can decide to concentrate on a specific type of crime for all geographies, or to take a specific county and show all the information about it.
